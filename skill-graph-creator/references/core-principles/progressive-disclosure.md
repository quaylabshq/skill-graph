# Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently.

## Loading Levels

1. **Metadata (name + description)** — Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** — When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** — As needed by Claude (unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)

## Patterns

### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start
Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]

## Advanced features
- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
```

Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.

### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

For skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── references/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

When a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.

Similarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants:

```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)
    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)
    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)
```

### Pattern 3: Conditional details

Show basic content, link to advanced content:

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents
Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents
For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

## Guidelines

- Keep SKILL.md body under 100 lines for graph-structured skills (navigation only)
- Avoid deeply nested references — keep references one level deep from SKILL.md, reachable within 2 hops
- Structure longer reference files (>100 lines) with a table of contents at the top
- All reference files must be linked from SKILL.md — no orphan files
